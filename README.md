This is a simple ESP32 BLE demo program.


To compile and run the code, you need to download an ESP32 arduino core and add it to your Arduino IDE.
You may go to the link below to download and install the arduino core

The arduino program also uses the dhp 11 library, you should download it before you compile.
The ADC port of esp32 are GPIO 32-39.
Since the ESP32 has an inaccurate ADC, you may use lower resistance pull-up resistor. In my demo code, I'm using 1 KÎ© resister for both DHP11 and the photocell.
The Android BLE app is API23 (Android 6.0).
